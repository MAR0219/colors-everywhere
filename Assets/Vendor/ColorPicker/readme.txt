How to use:

Drag the ColorPicker prefab into scene.

Listen to color change events by setting
the "receiver" attribute of the color picker.
The receiving object must implement a
"OnColorPickerValueChange" method.

Please see the ColorListener example for this.

You can also access the color directly by using
the function GetColor().

See the CopyColor example for this.
